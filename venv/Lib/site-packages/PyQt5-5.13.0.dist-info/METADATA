PyQt5 - Comprehensive Python Bindings for Qt v5
===============================================

What is PyQt5?
--------------

Qt is set of cross-platform C++ libraries that implement high-level APIs for
accessing many aspects of modern desktop and mobile systems.  These include
location and positioning services, multimedia, NFC and Bluetooth connectivity,
a Chromium based web browser, as well as traditional UI development.

PyQt5 is a comprehensive set of Python bindings for Qt v5.  It is implemented
as more than 35 extension modules and enables Python to be used as an
alternative application development language to C++ on all supported platforms
including iOS and Android.

PyQt5 may also be embedded in C++ based applications to allow users of those
applications to configure or enhance the functionality of those applications.
